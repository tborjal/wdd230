              <h2>Insurance</h2>
              <p>- The rental vehicle comes with a basic liability insurance that covers damage to the third party.

              <p>- When renting a vehicle in Cozumel, Mexico, it is crucial to understand the insurance options available. The basic liability insurance, included in the rental price, provides coverage for damages to third-party property or persons. For additional protection, the Collision Damage Waiver (CDW) reduces the Renter's financial responsibility for any damage or loss to the rental vehicle, with a deductible amount specified in the rental agreement. </p>
              <p>- Theft protection coverage reduces financial responsibility in case of theft or attempted theft, while personal accident insurance provides medical expenses and personal accident benefits in case of injury or death resulting from an accident while in the rental vehicle. Optional coverage selections and corresponding costs will be outlined in the rental agreement. </p>
              <p>- It is essential to carefully review the terms and conditions of each insurance option to make an informed decision that meets your needs and provides peace of mind during your rental period.</p>
